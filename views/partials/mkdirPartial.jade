                    p
                       | Mkdir BossCollection is a dedicated progression raiding guild.
                       | Our members have raiding experience ranging from vanilla, BC, and WOTLK all the way to the current expansion.
                    p
                        | While we take raiding seriously, we strive to maintain a fun team atmosphere when we play.
                        | If something is causing an issue for the raid, it will be addressed as humanely as possible.
                        | No one will be yelled at or verbally abused, but any member not pulling his or her weight will be informed.
                        | If immediate improvements are not made, we will begin vetting others for their position in our raids.
                    p
                        | We are currently still in the process of recruiting for our mythic team. We have establish a solid core
                        | raiding team.
                    p
                        | Still interested? PM "Chaunze" or "Defragmentor" in game to begin the vetting process.

                        | will prioritize those with no tier gear or those who are about to get a set bonus. Loot council
                        | will be the final decision.

                    p
                        | On official raid nights (as dictated below), raid members will not be allowed to bring an alt
                        | unless the entire raid night has been altered to an unofficial night. EG during a hoiday off week.
                        | We do this to maintain a consistent raiding experience so that we can gear our mains as quickly as possible.
                        | Alts are typically less geared and the players playing them are usually less proficient with them.
                        | So it's in the best interest of the groups progression to just keep members on their mains.
                        | We will schedule alt nights through out the week to best fit members availability (this will change regularly).
