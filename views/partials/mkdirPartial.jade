            div.row.text-center
                p
                   | We are a raiding guild. I have been playing since vanilla and have raided every expansion since. We will be a serious,
                   | consistently progressing guild. If any member should hold us back
                   | from that, he will be informed and if improvement is not made, he will be removed from the raiding team.
                p
                    | We will strive to have fun while we play. If something is giving us issues, it will be addressed as
                    | humanely as possible. I'm not going to yell at you or in general be a dick. However, I will inform
                    | you if you aren't pulling your weight.
                p
                    | I hope to get through normal flex raids as quickly as possible and push our way through heroics.
                    | The goal is down content pre-nerf. (Exceptions apply). If the raid team does well, we will progress
                    | from 10-15 man flex raids on to mythic content.
